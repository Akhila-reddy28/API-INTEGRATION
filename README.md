MY Task is to Create a API INTEGRATION ,I Have Choosen Earthquake Tracker.The Earthquake Tracker is a responsive, browser-based web application designed to fetch and display real-time earthquake data using modern web technologies. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it provides an interactive interface where users can apply filters such as minimum magnitude, location, and date range to view recent seismic events. The application retrieves its data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake API, which delivers up-to-date earthquake information in GeoJSON format.
The HTML defines the core layout, including input fields for filters, a section for safety alerts, and a container to display earthquake results. CSS styles the page for a clean and responsive user interface, enhancing readability and usability across devices. Custom styles are used for buttons, inputs, alerts, and earthquake entries. The JavaScript handles data fetching, filtering, and rendering. It applies user-defined filters, processes the API response, and displays the filtered results in real-time. Moreover, the application includes a dynamic alert system that triggers warnings if an earthquake of significant magnitude (e.g., 5.0 or above) is detected. This system highlights safety measures and color-coded alerts based on the earthquakeâ€™s severity, helping raise user awareness and promote disaster preparedness.
In terms of real-world application, this tool is highly relevant for educational purposes, disaster management initiatives, and public awareness campaigns. It can be integrated into science classroom environments to teach students about earthquake science and data-driven applications. Emergency response agencies can use it for quick overviews of recent seismic activity. Journalists and researchers can also benefit from its data filtering capabilities to extract earthquake information for specific regions and timeframes.Overall, this project demonstrates how open data, combined with web development, can create impactful and informative digital tools.
